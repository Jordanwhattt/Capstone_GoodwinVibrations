# Capstone_GoodwinVibrations
The Capstone Files we used in Matlab for our Capstone Presentation in May of 2023



Running the event subsets file and then the classificaiton test script with the proper timedat files, you should be able to produce a majority of the plots we used. 



Our data is not public, so if you have any questions about our data and/or problems running our scripts, please contact me via my email: JCHulb175@gmail.com
